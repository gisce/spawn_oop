Spawn Open Object Processes
===========================

Spawns OpenERP instances for functions that consumes a lot of cpu.


Requirements
============

Tested on OpenERP 5.0.X

You need to patch OpenERP server to let bind set a random port
patch -p1 < patches/random_port_on_startup.patch


Example
=======

from spawn_oop import spawn

from tools import config


class ResParner(osv.osv):
    """Inherit class from res.partner.
    """
    _inherit = 'res.parnter'


    @spawn(config['port'])
    def consumes_lot_of_cpu(self, cursor, uid, ids, context=None):
        """Some hard function.
        """
        y = 0
        for x in range(0, 10000000000):
            y += x
        return y

ResPartner()

When ResPartner.consumes_lot_of_cpu() is called, another OpenERP instance is 
started, then via xmlrpc we call consumes_lot_of_cpu() in that new instance,
so the main openerp process doesn't get overloaded.
